<h1>A Blog about Hacking, Cybersecurity, and Software Development</h1>

This blog was made with SvelteKit 1.0+. I had to relearn most of what I used to know since they introduced directory based routing, but SvelteKit is the shit. Check it out... Big congrats to Rich and the team on getting out of Beta and hitting the 1.0 milestone. w00t!
