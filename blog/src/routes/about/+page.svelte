<h1>About</h1>

<p>This blog went live late June 2023! I initially went with Hugo, then switched to Next.js, and finally decided to go back to what I know (a little bit) which is SvelteKit. I plan on posting notes here from my TryHackMe adventures, some software development eventually. Not here to show the world how rad I am (cause I'm really not 1337), but more like "Dude, this is where I keep my notes." Hoping somebody finds this gong show useful, my way of giving back to the internet. Anywho... Thank you, fellow netizen.</p>
